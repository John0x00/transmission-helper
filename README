rss.php 		- rss feed parser
transprocessor.php 	- called by transmission when download is completed. UnRars files, joins cd1/cd2 avis, etc
transcleanup.php 	- cleans up extracted files, removes old torrents, etc.
config.inc.php		- example config file, rename config.inc.php
www/index.php		- simple editor for search strings in the rss parser.

Requires PHP 5.3 with stuff.
Uses php-transmission-class - http://code.google.com/p/php-transmission-class/
Assumes php,unrar,mencoder binaries found in /usr/bin/ 

Basic Stuff:
* Edit includes/config.inc.php.example, save as includes/config.inc.php

TransCleanup:
Crontab the cleanup script - can run as often as you want. Once per day is likely enough.
Example:
	0 * * * * /path/to/transcleanup.php
On torrents that are stopped and/or Torrents older than maximum age:
- extracted files/directories/symlinks are deleted.
- transmission is told to delete the torrent and downloaded files.

TransProccessor:
- Executed by transmission when a download is completed. 
- Looks for rar files, etc - extracts them to the extract directory.
- With mencoder, and JOIN_AVI (config file) enabled, will attempt to join AVI files after extraction.
- Extracts subtitles, etc.
- Doesnt know how to handle much more than rar files. Creates a symlink if it cant handle the input files.

Edit your transmission daemon settings.json:
* Set "script-torrent-done-enabled": to true.
* Set "script-torrent-done-filename": to reflect the processor path
Example:
    "script-torrent-done-enabled": true,
    "script-torrent-done-filename": "/path/to/transprocessor",
(Dont forget to properly hup/reload transmission, or your changes will not be loaded and will be removed)

RSS Parser:
rss.php
RSS Example: 
	0,30 * * * * /path/to/rss.php -u "http://www.whatever.com/feed.rss"
- rss reader looks for mainly <title> and <link> fields. should work for your rss feed if those are there.
- To see more debug info, /path/to/rss.php -u "http://www.whatever.com/feed.rss" -d 2
- Dont bother adding to cron until you know if it works. (run manually)

www/index.php
* Make web accessible. 
* Make sure web user can read/write includes/file.types.inc.php, includes/file.ignores.inc.php
* Add an .htaccess password file etc
Simply reads/writes file.* files, allows quick/dirty editing from web.
Also reads includes/header-www.inc.php and includes/footer-www.inc.php - edit at will.


TODO
Better rar detection
Use transprocessor to queue all file handling, to make execution instant
Create handler system (or expand cleanup) to handle transprocessor requests - unrar,joins,etc
Create a better generic parser, web configurable?, Intial read-in of rss, let user select fields to parse.
Possibly use sqllite to replace flat files.
