rss.php 		- rss feed parser

config.inc.php		- example config file, rename config.inc.php
www/index.php		- simple editor for search strings in the rss parser.

Requires PHP 5.3 with stuff.
Uses php-transmission-class - http://code.google.com/p/php-transmission-class/
Assumes php,unrar,mencoder binaries found in /usr/bin/ 
Assumes transmission daemon is running locally.

Crontab the cleanup script - can run as often as you want. Once per day is likely enough.
Torrents that are stopped, Torrents older than maximum age:
* extracted files/directories/symlinks, download directory.
* Removes the torrent from transmission.
Example:
	0 * * * * /path/to/transcleanup.php

transProccessor:
Executed by transmission when a download is completed. 
Looks for rar files, etc - extracts them to the extract directory.
With mencoder, and joinavis enabled, will attempt to join AVI files after extraction.
Extracts subtitles, etc.
Doesnt know how to handle much more than rar files. Creates a symlink if it cant handle the input files.

Edit your transmission daemon settings.json:
* Set "script-torrent-done-enabled": to true.
* Set "script-torrent-done-filename": to reflect the processor path
Example:
    "script-torrent-done-enabled": true,
    "script-torrent-done-filename": "/path/to/transprocessor",

RSS Example: (You will have to hack up rss.php, before you bother with this, unless you use the same site i do)
0,30 * * * * /path/to/rss.php
